         <h4>Bio</h4>
         <p>I have just moved from Sydney, Australia, to Seattle with my partner. I graduated from the Australian National University with a Bachelor of  Science (Advanced) with first class honors in Chemistry. I have experience in Research, Pharmaceutical and Utility industries. Currently, I am hoping to make a career change into the tech industry.</p>

         <h4>Goals</h4>
         <p>In the short term, I hope to learn code and transition from a career in Science to one in Tech. Ideally, I'd love to work somewhere that I can use both skills of knowing how to code and my knowledge of chemistry and genetics I gained during my degree. I am determined to build up a portfolio of work and improve my coding skills through the Code fellows school.</p>
